# MCP Integration Status with LiteLLM and Open WebUI

**Date**: 2025-09-07
**Status**: Partial Success - Function Detection Working, Execution Not Implemented

## Summary

MCP (Model Context Protocol) tools are successfully configured and models can detect them as OpenAI-compatible functions. However, neither LiteLLM nor Open WebUI automatically execute these functions - they only pass the function calls through.

## What's Working ✅

### 1. Function Detection
- Models correctly identify when to use MCP tools
- Function calls are properly formatted in OpenAI format
- Role-based access control via API keys works

### 2. Network Isolation
- MCP proxy successfully isolated on Docker network
- Port 8585 not exposed to host (security requirement met)
- LiteLLM can reach MCP proxy via internal network

### 3. Test Results
```
Admin Key Tests:
- Filesystem access: ✓ Tool call detected
- PostgreSQL access: ✓ Tool call detected  
- Monitoring access: ✓ Tool call detected

Developer Key Tests:
- Filesystem access: ✓ Tool call detected (needs permission enforcement)
- PostgreSQL access: ✓ Tool call detected
- Monitoring access: ✓ Tool call detected
```

## What's Not Working ❌

### 1. Function Execution
- LiteLLM doesn't execute function calls automatically
- Open WebUI doesn't have built-in function execution
- Function results aren't returned to the model

### 2. MCP Proxy Issues
- Some MCP services failing due to missing Node.js dependencies
- Container management creating unnamed containers
- Wrapper scripts need refinement

## Architecture Findings

### Current Flow (Not Complete)
```
User → Open WebUI → LiteLLM → Model
                                 ↓
                          Detects function need
                                 ↓
                          Returns function call
                                 ↓

```

### Required Flow
```
User → Open WebUI → LiteLLM → Model
                                 ↓
                          Detects function need
                                 ↓
                          Returns function call
                                 ↓
                        [Function Executor Needed]
                                 ↓
                           Execute MCP tool
                                 ↓
                         Return result to model
                                 ↓
                          Final response to user
```

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Custom Middleware (Recommended)
Build a middleware service that:
1. Intercepts LiteLLM responses with function calls
2. Executes MCP tools via the proxy
3. Returns results back through the chain

**Pros**: Full control, proper integration
**Cons**: Requires development effort

### Option 2: LiteLLM Plugin
Develop a LiteLLM plugin that handles function execution:
1. Use LiteLLM's callback system
2. Execute MCP tools when detected
3. Automatically handle the conversation flow

**Pros**: Native LiteLLM integration
**Cons**: LiteLLM documentation limited on this

### Option 3: Open WebUI Extension
Create an Open WebUI extension for function handling:
1. Intercept chat completions
2. Detect function calls
3. Execute and return results

**Pros**: UI-level integration
**Cons**: Open WebUI architecture may not support this

### Option 4: Direct Claude Code Integration
Skip the web UI and use MCP directly in Claude Code:
1. MCP servers already work in Claude Code
2. Direct tool access without middleware
3. No web UI needed

**Pros**: Works today, no additional development
**Cons**: Not accessible via web interface

## Configuration Files Created

### 1. Function Definitions
- `/home/administrator/projects/litellm/mcp-functions.yaml` - MCP tool definitions
- `/home/administrator/projects/litellm/config-mcp-enabled.yaml` - LiteLLM config with MCP

### 2. Test Scripts
- `test-mcp-tools.py` - Python test for MCP tools
- `test-openwebui-mcp.sh` - Bash test via Open WebUI
- `test-function-calling.py` - Verify function calling works

### 3. Middleware Attempts
- `mcp_middleware.py` - Middleware for MCP execution (not integrated)
- `litellm_mcp_handler.py` - Custom callback handler (not loaded)

## Key Learnings

1. **LiteLLM Behavior**: LiteLLM is a proxy, not an execution engine. It passes function calls through but doesn't execute them.

2. **Open WebUI Limitations**: Open WebUI expects the LLM backend to handle function execution, which LiteLLM doesn't do.

3. **MCP Design**: MCP servers are designed for stdio communication, making HTTP/SSE bridging complex.

4. **Security Success**: Network isolation goal achieved - MCP proxy not accessible from host.

## Recommendations

### For Immediate Use
1. Use MCP tools directly in Claude Code (they work there)
2. Use standard LLMs through Open WebUI without MCP tools
3. Consider MCP tools as Claude Code exclusive for now

### For Future Development
1. Build proper middleware service for function execution
2. Consider contributing to LiteLLM for native MCP support
3. Investigate Open WebUI plugin architecture

## Testing Commands

### Verify Function Detection
```bash
# Shows models detect functions but don't execute
cd /home/administrator/projects/litellm
python3 test-mcp-tools.py
```

### Test Through Open WebUI
```bash
# Shows Open WebUI passes through but doesn't execute
./test-openwebui-mcp.sh
```

### Direct Function Test
```bash
# Proves function calling works in LiteLLM
python3 test-function-calling.py
```

## Current Workaround

For users who need MCP tools with AI:
1. Use Claude Code directly (MCP tools work there)
2. For web access, use Open WebUI with standard LLMs (no MCP)
3. Consider manual tool execution based on model suggestions

## Next Steps

1. **Decision Required**: Choose solution approach (middleware, plugin, or keep as-is)
2. **If Proceeding**: Build function execution layer
3. **Alternative**: Document as "MCP for Claude Code only"

## Summary for User

**What was requested**: "I want with litellm to have the AI's and MCP tools so when I connect to litellm, i can use the models, and the models have access to my MCP's"

**What was achieved**:
- ✅ Models can see and request MCP tools
- ✅ Network security implemented (port 8585 isolated)
- ✅ Role-based access control ready
- ❌ Automatic execution not implemented
- ❌ End-to-end flow not complete

**Current Status**: Models know about MCP tools and try to use them, but the execution layer is missing. This requires additional development to complete the integration.
